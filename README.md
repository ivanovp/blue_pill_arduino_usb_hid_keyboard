# blue_pill_arduino_usb_hid_keyboard
Macro keyboard which uses Blue Pill (STM32F103) development board and Arduino framework.
Pressing a key sends Alt-Windows-F1 (or any combination you want) through USB to the host. The software is very simple: 
to change the key, you need to compile and re-program the device.
There is 3D printed case and 3D printed keycaps for the keyboard, but you can create your own case of course.
